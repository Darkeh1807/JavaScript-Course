// Variables are like containers we store stuffs
// The stuffs we store in this containers are what we refer to as values
// Hence variables take in values 
// So you might want to know where this values are stored right?
// They are stored in the computer memory
// Once you assign a value to a javascript variable, it can be used everywhere within your file by referencing
// What do I mean by referencing?
// In javascript, variables are being declared
// We declare a vriable by using the var,let or const keyword, naming your variable, assigning values and terminating them with a semicolon 

// The difference between let and const are, 

// You can declare a variable with the let keyword without initalization and values of let defined keyword can be modified Anytime 
// You cannot declare a variable with the const keyword without initalization and values of const defined keyword cannot be modified once declared 

// Anytime you want to make use of your variables, you just call the name of the variable and this is what we refer to as refrencing
// Now lets have a look at some examples of variables
var creditCardNumber;
const amountGiving="2700.45 cedis";
let myName;

// lets try outputing amount given to the console
// We do that by using the log function "log()"


console.log(amountGiving);




// creditCardNumber and let myName are referred to as uninitialized variables since they hold no values(data)
// Therfore we hsve created 2 empty containers and a container witrh a value in the computer memory
//We can now use them anywhere we
